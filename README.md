## React Router v6 Nested Route Issue
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem involves a nested route that unexpectedly fails to render the intended component. The solution involves correcting how the nested routes are defined to ensure proper rendering of the nested component.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code, while `AppSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
